# crafting-interpreters

This is my code for working through the amazing book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## TODOs
* Chapter 14 Challenge 2 (allowing for more than 256 constants)
* Chapter 14 Challenge 3 (implement and profile a few malloc/realloc/free implementations)
* Get [the tests](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test) working
* Chapter 15 Challenge 3 (expanding VM stacks) (or at least handle overflows gracefully)
* Chapter 16 Challenge 1 (string interpolation)
* Replace the REPL's rudimentary string reading with either GNU Readline or Linenoise
* Replace the argument parsing in main.c with [argp](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argp.html)
